## Risk Assessment

### Legal Risks (Mitigated)

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| CFAA Violation | User authorization + audit trail | ✅ Mitigated |
| ToS Violation | Respect rate limits + disclaimers | ✅ Mitigated |
| Fraud | No falsification + user control | ✅ Mitigated |
| Contributory Liability | Terms of Service + prohibited use clauses | ✅ Mitigated |

### Remaining Considerations

⚠️ **User Misuse** - Users can still violate laws; Terms of Service provides protection  
⚠️ **Platform Changes** - Chrome Web Store policies may evolve  
⚠️ **Legal Precedent** - New case law may affect interpretation  
⚠️ **International Law** - Different jurisdictions have different standards
